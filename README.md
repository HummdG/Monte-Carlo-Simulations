# Monte-Carlo-Simulations
Currently two experiments have been implemented:
## Predicting the Value of Pi
* Made a Monte Carlo simulation for predicting the value of Pi
* Applied the simulation for different number of uniformly generated samples
### Next steps:
* Use different types of probability distributions
* Increase the prediction precision

## Stock Price Simulation
* Made a Monte Carlo simulation for predicting the daily stock price
* Applied different probability distributions:
  * Uniform
  * Triangular
  * Gaussian
* Applied Monte Carlo simulations to Apple
### Next steps:
* Implement a yearly predicition model
* Keep applying simulation to real companies (current companies: APPL)

## Further Work:
* Currently implementing a queuing theory simulation
